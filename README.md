etterfilterSamples
==================

Some FONCTIONNAL sample of filter for Ettercap (some Etterfilter) 

## Introduction

This project is associated to the others mine : 
- https://github.com/pilebones/backdoorBash
- https://github.com/pilebones/hostingBackdoorInstaller

The main goals of this project is to implement an attack scenario as below : 
- Implement backdoor like remote-shell with Bash
- Attack Man In the middle with Ettercap (like ARP Spoofing)
- Hosting a backdoor installer
- Automate data alteration to inject our backdoor inside the computer of target by a browser
- If the target run (naively) the script (ie: the backdoor installer) without reading code source the computer is infected and the attacker can obtain a remote access command
- Detect and prevent this kind of attack with NIDS tool as Snort

Notice :
- The programming language was choose only for a Proof of Concept (POC)
- The socket layer is assumed by a portable version of Netcat. I compiled Netcat for i686 and x86_64 computer architecture a put the binary inside this project.
- The transmited data were encrypted with AES-128 (without using Cryptocat). The data are encrypted on the fly via OpenSSL.

## Requirements

- ettercap (v0.8.1)
- etterfilter (v0.8.1)

## How it work ?
_TODO_
